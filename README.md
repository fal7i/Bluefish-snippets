# Bluefish-snippets
my own snippets for the Bluefish editor

see https://bfwiki.tellefsen.net/index.php/Snippets_plugin
and https://bfwiki.tellefsen.net/index.php/Snippets_syntax


Editing tools for HTML, CSS and javascript in Bluefish are very outdated. 
I'll take the time to update, starting for convenience with snippets.
I think 
1. MDN and W3C documentation are good sources, 
  - https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element
  - see also: https://htmlreference.io/

2. html-xml-utils are good tools.
