# Bluefish-snippets
my own snippets for the Bluefish editor

see https://bfwiki.tellefsen.net/index.php/Snippets_plugin
and https://bfwiki.tellefsen.net/index.php/Snippets_syntax


Editing tools for HTML, CSS and javascript in Bluefish are very outdated. 
I'll take the time to update, starting for convenience with snippets.
I think MDN and W3C documentation are good sources, html-xml-utils are good tools.
